I learned this from the simulation graphs like the one drawn above. If the particles are above the potential energy curve, then they have a chance to be able to react. The faster the particles are moving aka the more total energy there is, the larger the range of total products that the simulation gets. This is because the reactions are occurring more commonly and also happening faster.\n",

Your answer: The most important thing we learned this week was that the simulation was completely random and it is completely random when all the products of the reactants will be equal to each other. However, there are some things that can quicken this occurrence. By raising the temperature, the particles produce products faster because they are moving faster and bumping into each other thus creating products faster. Also, you can add more particles. By doing this there is less room for the particles to move around in and they will react sooner. That being said, it is random when, where, and how the particles hit each other so it is impossible to know when all the products will be equal. \n",

Your answer: I think that the most important thing we learned this week was that the maximum amount of products possible is the sum of the initial products put into the box added to the amount of reactants (which ever reactant there is less of). This is because there is only as certain amount of particles that create reactions together.  Also we learned that the particles reactions increase with heat, because they were moving faster therefore giving more opportunities to cause a reaction.  The temperature also effects the total average energy line and causes it to move up, which involved more of the potential energy curve which proves that the amount of reactions increases with the temperature.   \n",

Not only is it relevant to what we are learning (the equilibrium that is reached when the only reactions happening are fluctuations back and forth), its also important in other scenarios.  Equilibrium is that state of being that is reached when something (reactions, movement etc.) no longer has a trend, when it is no longer going somewhere. There can still be movement but it must revolve around a center point and return to it frequently. Equilibrium is seen in all kinds of situations, such as a skater on a curved ramp, or in the reactions between to chemicals.\n",

We learned that equilibrium is NOT when the forces don\u2019t fluctuate but when they balance each other out eventually. An example that Mark used to prove this was flipping a coin. He flipped a coin and every time he got heads he stepped forward and when he got tails stepped backwards. He eventually hit the wall going forward symbolizing that data fluctuates. However, eventually, if he flipped the coin enough, he would end up near where he started because the two would balance each other out. This was the best explanation he gave because it showed it in real terms.\n",

This is what we were doing with the lab and using different connections of molecules to try and find how long it took, at different temperatures, for them to reach the equilibrium.

Equilibrium is the state in which opposite forces are at a balance. An example of this is in the simulation, you can see how many of each molecules are on the box. You can say how many you want to start out with. If you say 20 A and 20 BC and then click on the begin experiment, you will see on the graph when the lines are at the same point then there are even amount of A and BC in the simulation box. That is how you know there is equilibrium, when the two different molecules are at a balance or even amount.\n",

Also we learned how to tell when a reaction has reached its equilibrium, because sometimes it is very hard to tell.  This is important when looking at a graph of a reaction to tell when it is \"over\"  (i put over in \"\" because once a reaction reaches its equilibrium it stops say producing bubbles even though a reaction is still going on.  It is just a very small on.  Equilibrium is a very important concept and it is also important to under stand that equilibrium isnt when something isn't moving (in the settings that we are looking at) it is number that the particles are always revolve around.

We figured out that after a reaction the speed of the molecules stay then same, they do not get faster or slower but keep a steady pace. Before the molecules collide only A is moving. When they collide the momentum from A is transferred to B and C, causing them to move and causing A to slow down.  \n",

        "2. Your answer: The combination of learning what equilibrium is (starting to understand at least) and knowing how to find where an experiment ends from analyzing graphs are the two most important things we learned this week.  Based off of this week, my definition of what equilibrium is the point of where the trend (of an experiment, in this case the chemical reaction) ends and balances out. When Mark drew the picture of a skater going down a valley like area, the central-bottom-most-point of the skaters track (shaped like a parabolaISH) is the point of equilibrium. This is because that point cancels out the trend of the skater going down. For visual, look at the picture attached under fridays notes). Looking at the point of equilibrium graph wise, you can tell where the point of equilibrium is, and therefore where the experiment ends(because that is where the trend/reaction ends), by looking at the general trend of the data stops. For example, if the graph of the experiment is tending towards slanting upwards, then the experiment is not over. This 'trend' is not the line of best fit, but is similar in the way that the line of best fit graphs the general direction of the graph.\n",

This is important because to understand how reactions work, be it chemical or not, we must understand the basics of what goes on in a reaction, like in the simulation. We know this is true, because as we saw in the simulation, when the two particles collided, the one particle broke off from it's original particle and hooked onto the particle that collided with the original. \n",

This is important because it has to do with the way we study particles. We study them in large groups so we are more likely to observe change if it is supposed to happen.  Just look at a coinflip. If we flip 1 coin, we are either going to get heads or tails. But that is just one coin. If 50 coins all land heads, we are more likely to see it as strange.   If one particle reacts, we can't really see it. If 5 million do, It'll be obvious\n",

In most of the simulations we have used so far the answer would stay the same because the numbers were definite, however in this simulation it involved chance and so the numbers would change each time. I think that this is important to show that in science sometimes one can never get the same answer twice which brings up a lot of difficulty in the science world about how to define a complete answer. My answer is just as right as the person next to me but they are completely different, but we question each other on the correctness of our answers and more and more people join into the argument because each one of us got a different thing. All it takes is for one person to do it twice to realize that they too get a different answer the second time.  Hope this is good :3\n",

Sometimes he would get four heads and one tail or vise versa. I know this is true because on the simulator we were using, we did multiple experiments.

        "2. Your answer: The most important thing we learned this week is in the simulation the way the molecules move around is random but it is a random pattern. For example, flipping a coin is random because it could land heads or it could land tails but if the coin was flipped a hundred times it would not land heads 100 times in a row, the number of times it lands heads would be in between 70-30 almost every time. Even though it is random which side lands up each time. This is very similar to the simulation because if 200 A molecules and 200 B molecules were in the box instead of 20 then because there is less space for them to move they would bump into each other and cause a reaction on a more consistent bases. This is very important because it explains why the simulations gives different answers where as when you watch a reaction it happens very similar every time because there are more molecules reacting. I know this is true because it makes logical sense that the more molecules are in there the less room for chance there is because there is less room for them to move.\n",
        "\n",
        "Comment: Nice observation and explanation.  To extend it a bit, do you think that there being less room in the box is the full explanation for the fact that the times are less random when there are more particles?  Is there anything else about there being more particles that makes the result less apparently random?\n",

For example, with the chemical simulation \"Rates and Reactions\" with reaction 1, if you merely put one of each reactant and launched one of the reactants at the other, they would bounce of each other and not react. However, if you set the energy above the potential energy graph, by giving it more heat, you can force the reaction to happen. Further, the more energy you give the reaction, the faster the reaction occurs and hits it's equilibrium, as evidenced by our experiments. This is important because I think it is an important corner stone to my chemistry knowledge and I think it will be instrumental as we continue to progress through the Chemistry unit and studying chemical reactions. If we are trying to study a particular reaction and nothing is happening, I now know that simply more energy is required to make the reaction occur and can react accordingly. \n",

        "2. Your answer: An important thing i learned this week was to speed up a chemical reaction i can add heat. The heat causes the molecules to move around faster and faster and they start to hit each other more often. When the molecules hit they combine and create a new substance.  I know this because in the simulation we added more heat and the molecules started picking up speed. When the molecules hit they stuck together until something else hit again. When ever a molecule would hit at least one of them would latch on to another molecule. The two molecules stuck to each other were like two reactants mixing. \n",

        "Comment: Nice observations, though it sounds like you are saying that every collision led to a reaction where the molecules would break and reform -- is that what you saw?\n",

Your answer: I just learned what equilibrium was today, but one of the most important things I learned this week is that the reactants create products keeping the reactants the same number one inputs into the experiment. Many things can affect the time outcome of the products. For one, temperature. As the temperature increases so does the speed of the times reactants make products as well as the Total average energy level. I know this is true because my group and I tested multiple times of how much temperature increases the time that products are created from reactants.   \n",

Your answer: This week, the most important thing I thing Iearned was when you have have different numbers of molecules, depending on how many of each different molecule their are, the final number at their trend line is relativity close, if not the same no matter the temperature. This is always the same, except for zero because the two lines will become parallel and never meet. This is important because when taking data and previously learning about the subject, loss of gain of heat had a large impact on the movement, while when you have multiple molecules connecting, it does not change that much.       \n",

        "2. Your answer: The most important thing we learned this week is that when the molecule groups (Bc, Ac) move fast enough, the molecules will latch onto other molecules and create new groups (A+Bc becomes AB+c). This is important to know because it explains why new molecules groups are formed (and new substances like foam, gas, or bubbles) during a chemical reaction. We know this because in our simulations we saw that the faster the molecules were moving, the more new molecules groups were created. During a chemical change, molecules move really fast which causes them to create new groups, just like in the simulation. \n",
