Constructing a report is a question of selecting some
slices of the data in a class file, possibly manipulating
it, and outputting a display of the results.

Some standard reports I will certainly want:
 * display all records for a given student
 * display a subset of records for a student (all HW, all or subset of scores)
 * display attendance patterns
 * compute and display averages or grades
 * display all records for a given skill
 * compute and display averages for a given skill, HW, etc.
 * show class, section, gender, etc. results


My question is how to parse the data file quickly, and then how to
internally store that data so that useful queries can be made
and informative reports generated.  And of course I want to maintain
a human-readable (and editable) file format at all times without
proliferating support files. And I want to learn something
in the process of making this.
